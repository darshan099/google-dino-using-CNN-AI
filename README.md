# google-dino-using-CNN-AI

Have you ever played google's dino? Have you ever wished to have a great competitor to beat your high score? Well, we have developed a Machine Learning model that uses Convolution Neural Network to let the dino play on its own!

#Steps before you start

1. Import the following libraries
   a. OpenCv
   b. numpy
   c. pandas
   d. pyautogui
   e. keras
   f. pillow

2. grab the region of the screen
    1. open your google chrome
    2. type "chrome://dino" in your address bar
	3. make sure that nothing blocks the dino
	   
3. run "main.py"

note: this model works only for windows. linux versions will be updated soon :)
